<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I'm really passionate about the STEM field, especially robotics and computer vision, and I'm working toward becoming an expert and building a career in it. I also care a lot about education, and right now, I'm helping set up a vocational training center as an operations manager to give high school and college grads the chance to work in Japan.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Alongside my professional goals, I aspire to become a STEM content creator, especially in engineering, to share knowledge and inspire others. To build this skill, Iâ€™m starting with simple math content as a stepping stone, experimenting with ways to communicate complex concepts in a clear, engaging way.</p>
